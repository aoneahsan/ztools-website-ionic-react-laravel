# TODO

## State related issues
  
- remove auth token recoil state completely from project, as we are getting that directing from localstorage while sending API request

## Refactors

- in whole project make sure we are using "useZIonAlert", "useZIonLoading", and same for all other ionic hooks, create a custom hook for them and use that.
