# Here we will define the rules for our app layout

- Dashboard

  - every dashboard page, will have the main sidebar (with main pages links)
    - and similarly on smaller screen this main sidebar will become the main topbar for every page

  - as we have given the app logo in main sidebar so no page will have the app logo in the top-bar of that page (if it is some other location, then please discuss with me)
  - main side
